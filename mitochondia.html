<h1>Mitochondia</h1> 

<p> The mitochondrion (plural mitochondria) is a double-membrane-bound organelle found in most eukaryotic organisms. Some cells in some multicellular organisms may, however, lack them (for example, mature mammalian <a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentID=34&ContentTypeID=160">redblood cells</a>). A number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids, and diplomonads, have also reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures.[1] To date, only one eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria.[2] The word mitochondrion comes from the Greek μίτος, mitos, "thread", and χονδρίον, chondrion, "granule"[3] or "grain-like". Mitochondria generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy.[4] </p>

<p> Mitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3 μm in diameter[5] but vary considerably in size and structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth.[6] Mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes.[7][8] Mitochondria have been implicated in several human diseases, including mitochondrial disorders,[9]cardiac dysfunction,[10] heart failure[11] and autism.[12] </p>
